# MyReads Project:

This is my resolution for the Udacity's React Nanodegree's first code challenge.

- There's BooksAPI that is consumed.
- The app organizes books into 3 shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.
- There's a Search page where the user can search for more books and add them to their shelves if they want to.

## Demo

- Open [live demo](https://florantara.github.io/react-project-1)

## To install

- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
